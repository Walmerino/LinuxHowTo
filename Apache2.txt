In this project I'm setting up a LAMP stack. Although nowadays it's considered a legacy stack I consider it a intresting begining towards more modern approachs. I'm also moving from mysql to postgresql in this projec, simply because this is the database I had already installed on my Raspberry Pi before-hand. I'm doing this project via ssh with a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B Rev 1.2 on my local network. I'm using SCP to upload the files into the server. I will also uso PDO_PGSQL to integrate the database to the  PHP.

Update Raspberry system:

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

Check Raspberry Pi system:

cat /proc/cpuinfo

Model		: Raspberry Pi 3 Model B Rev 1.2

cat /etc/os-release

"Raspbian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye)"

Install Apache2:

sudo apt install apache2 -y

Check the server:

hostname -I

When you install the apache server, it will create your web server root directory, all files shown here are exposed by the webserver: E.g. /var/www/html/index.html 

Install Postgresql:

sudo apt install postgresql -y

Send file using scp to the remote host:

First change permissios to the apache root folder:

sudo chmod 777 /var/www/html/

Then send the file using the commands scp:

scp /directory/path/file_name user_name@x.x.x.x:/var/www/html

change permissios back to default 775
